# Data-Science-Assignments
2 assignments part of an Online Data Science Course where I learned to use Pandas and concepts like Data Frames and Series. The first dataset was represented by the medals obtained by various countries at the olympic games, and the second was a list of indicators of energy supply and renewable electricity production from the US.
